## Overview
[Project Repport](https://github.com/Silent0Wings/Cross-Platform-Password-Manager/blob/939fe0b17c4e90f2708c98d06b8d6cb6afb32336/Github.pdf).

The Cross-Platform Password Manager is a robust Java-based desktop application tailored for secure and efficient password management across any operating system capable of running Java. This includes a wide range of platforms such as Windows (from version 7 to 11), most Linux distributions, and macOS. The application leverages AES 256-bit encryption to safeguard all stored passwords, ensuring the highest level of data security. Passwords are organized in an intuitive tree structure, akin to folders and files, which allows users to easily manage, sort, label, and flag their credentials. Beyond basic password management, the application integrates a built-in command line interface (CLI) for advanced operations and offers extensive customization options, making it a versatile tool for both casual users and professionals.

## Features

- **AES 256 Encryption**: All passwords are protected with AES 256-bit encryption, the industry standard for secure data storage, ensuring your sensitive information remains confidential.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The application is designed to run on any operating system that supports Java, including Windows (7 through 11), various Linux distributions, and macOS. This makes it an ideal solution for users who operate across multiple platforms.

- **Tree Structure Organization**: Passwords are stored in a hierarchical tree structure, similar to how files are organized within folders. This structure allows users to categorize passwords efficiently, making retrieval and management straightforward.

- **Advanced Command Line Interface**: The built-in CLI allows users to perform a wide range of operations on their password storage, including batch processing, complex sorting, and more. This feature is particularly useful for power users who prefer using command line operations for efficiency.

- **Customizable Interface**: Users have full control over the application's appearance. The interface can be customized to suit individual preferences, including font selection from the system's available fonts, adjustable base size for all elements, and theme adjustments. This customization ensures a comfortable and personalized user experience.

- **Operating System Detection**: The application automatically detects the operating system on which it is running and adjusts its saving behaviors accordingly. It also records the most frequently used save locations for easy access, streamlining the workflow.

- **Interactive and Resizable UI**: The user interface is fully interactive and resizable, adapting to various screen sizes and resolutions. This ensures that the application remains usable and visually appealing on any device.

- **Custom Tooltips and Menus**: To enhance usability, the application features custom-built tooltips that provide context-sensitive help and left-click drop-down menus that offer quick access to commonly used functions.

- **Automatic Password Generation**: The application includes a sophisticated password generator that creates secure passwords using extended ASCII characters. Users can customize the complexity and length of the generated passwords to meet specific security requirements.

- **Adaptive Design**: The application's adaptive design ensures that it provides a consistent user experience across different operating systems. It intelligently adjusts to the userâ€™s environment, whether they are on Windows, Linux, or macOS, providing seamless integration and operation.

- **Security Best Practices**: In addition to AES 256 encryption, the application follows security best practices, such as securely handling user inputs, using strong random number generators for password creation, and ensuring that all sensitive operations are performed in a secure environment.

- **Backup and Restore Functionality**: The application includes tools for backing up and restoring password databases, ensuring that your data is protected against accidental loss. Backups can be encrypted for added security.

- **Multi-User Support**: The application can handle multiple user profiles, allowing each user to have their own set of passwords and settings. This is particularly useful for shared computers or environments where multiple users need to access the password manager.

- **Audit and Reporting**: Users can generate reports on password usage, strength, and changes over time. This feature helps in maintaining strong security practices by identifying weak or reused passwords that need to be updated.

## Usage
use this to run the executable java files (.jar) files :
  java -jar Password_Manager_Ob.jar
- **Password Management**: Easily store, organize, and manage your passwords within a hierarchical tree structure. This organization method ensures that related passwords are grouped together, making them easier to find and manage.

- **Command Line Operations**: Use the integrated CLI for advanced operations, such as batch updates, complex sorting, and automated tasks. This feature is ideal for users who prefer or require command-line efficiency.

- **Customization**: Tailor the application's interface to your liking, from selecting your preferred font to adjusting the overall size of UI elements. The interface customization options ensure a user-friendly experience that can be adapted to any screen size and personal preference.

- **Automatic Password Generation**: Create strong, secure passwords with the built-in generator, which allows customization of password length, complexity, and character sets. This tool ensures that all your passwords meet the highest security standards.

- **Adaptive Design and OS Integration**: Benefit from an application that seamlessly integrates with your operating system, adapting to its specific behaviors and saving locations. The software automatically adjusts to provide the best user experience based on the OS environment.

- **Security Management**: Keep your passwords safe with AES 256 encryption and take advantage of backup and restore functionalities to protect your data from accidental loss. Multi-user support allows multiple profiles, each with its own set of encrypted passwords.
